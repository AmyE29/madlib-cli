I, the fluffu and blue Amy have shot Kevin's pretty sister and plan to steal her yeloow shoes!

What are a Sasquatch and backpacking ferret to do? Before you can help Jenny, you'll have to collect the spiky pineapples and shiny bunnies that open up the 34 worlds connected to Paul Lair. There are 5 pickles and 6 pumpkins in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
